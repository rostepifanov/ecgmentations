## Installation
Installation from PyPI:

```
pip install ecgmentations
```

Installation from GitHub:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/rostepifanov/ecgmentations
```

## A simple example
```python
import numpy as np
import ecgmentations as E

# Declare an augmentation pipeline
transform = E.Sequential([
    E.Reverse(p=0.5),
    E.ChannelShuffle(p=0.06),
])

# Create example ecg
ecg = np.ones((12, 5000)).T

# Augment an ecg
transformed = transform(ecg=ecg)
transformed_ecg = transformed['ecg']
```
